# MSTestEnhancer

Don't you think that naming is very very hard? Especially naming for unit test method? Read this article for more data of naming: [Don’t go into programming if you don’t have a good thesaurus - ITworld](https://www.itworld.com/article/2833265/cloud-computing/don-t-go-into-programming-if-you-don-t-have-a-good-thesaurus.html).

MSTestEnhancer helps you to write unit tests without naming any method.

MSTestEnhancer is a contract-style unit test extension for MSTestv2. You can write method contract descriptions instead of writing confusing test method name when writing unit tests.
